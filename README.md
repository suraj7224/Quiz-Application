# Quiz-Application
I have created Quiz Application with the use of Python, tkinter Programming languages. In this Quiz Application I have used MySQL Programming Language for Store data. Basically, with the use of this project we have to give the test. The best part of this test is questions are jumbled. When test is over at the end of test display the marks and a small message with an image. Also, at the end of test you have to put your username and click the send button. when you click on the send button your score will be sent to your email which you gave while registering.

In this project I have used different types of modules: 
1.	Plyer Module: (simple Desktop Notifier application using Python)

time: This module works with the time object and is installed by default.

Plyer: Plyer module is used to access the features of the hardware. This module does not come built-in with Python. We need to install it externally. To install this module, type the below command in the terminal.

Run this command: 
pip install plyer 

2.	Win32com: 
There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in python. One of such APIs available in the python library commonly known as win32com library.

Run the following command to add pywin32 to Python:
python -m pip install pywin32

Note: 
1.	In Reg.py file put your email and password in line no 140 and 145 respectively. Then and then only you can send score on the respective candidate email.
2.	In Taketest.py file put your email and password in line no 127 and 128 respectively. Then and then only you can send score on the respective candidate email.
